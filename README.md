A computer vision project I made that takes in a clip of a person hitting a tennis forehand and tells you whether it is good or bad depending on the form of the shot. I explain the whole process in the jupyter notebook. I had to create my own dataset which means there is a chance for overfitting, but I am sure if I expanded the dataset it would be fine. Creating the dataset was quite tedious so I stopped at around 26 videos, but in the future I hope to improve this project.
