A computer vision project I made that takes in a clip of a person hitting a tennis forehand and tells you whether it is good or bad depending on the form of the shot. I explain the whole process in the jupyter notebook. I had to create my own dataset which means there is a chance for overfitting, but I am sure if I expanded the dataset it would be fine. Creating the dataset was quite tedious so I stopped at around 26 videos, but in the future I hope to improve this project. 

Did not commit the frames folder because it was too much, but basically it contained a png image for each frame for every video clip. For example for video_a1 there would be a directory inside the frames folder named frames_a1 and it would have about 80 frames of the forehand swing.

Go to model/model.ipynb to see the jupyter notebook with all the juicy details :)
